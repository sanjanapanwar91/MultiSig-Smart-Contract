1: Owners: Define a list of wallet owners who must collectively agree on transactions.

2: Transaction Proposals: Owners can propose transactions to be executed.

3: Confirmation: Owners can confirm proposed transactions.

4: Execution: Transactions are executed once a predefined number of owners confirm them.
